## IDE
**Visual Studio Code :** is a very open and open source editor by Microsoft, built with the Electron framework - meaning it's written using JavaScript and Node.js. It has default help for a few languages, however superior help may be provided for any language using plugins or extensions. If you need software in Python, the extension you are looking for is Microsoft Python. This extension was made advance by Don Jayamanne as an unbiased project but was finally taken over by Microsoft.

**PyCharm :** is a full-featured IDE advanced with the help of using JetBrains especially for Python development. Written in Java and Python, it offers many possibilities for out-of-field Python development. There's a problem: the best community model is free, and the expert model fee is about two hundred dollars with the year.

I will work on Visual Studio Code.
## Operating System
**Windows :** is a licensed operating system and its source code is not accessible. It is designed for enterprise owners, various industrial users, or even people who have no knowledge of laptop programming. It is straightforward and easy to use.

**Linux :** is a free and open source operating system based on Unix requirements that offers programming interface in addition to person interface compatibility. It additionally consists of many one by one advanced elements, with out proprietary code.
I will work on Linux commind line.
## Version-control platform
**GitHub :** is a Git-based repository web website hosting platform with 40 million users (January 2020) making it the largest source code globally. Originally, GitHub was released in 2008. GitHub projects can go public and all code shared publicly is open to everyone for free. You can have private projects too, but only 3 collaborators are allowed on the free plan.

**GitLab :** is a repository manager that allows teams to collaborate on code. Written in Ruby and Go, GitLab offers some similar features for problem tracking and project management as GitHub. Companies such as IBM, Sony, and NASA use it.

I will work on GitHub.
# Task 2.2
## Comparison between VS Code and PyCharm :
1. Performance: Even while IDE PyCharm consumes about 1GB of memory on my machine, at the same time as VS Code remains below 300MB in almost all cases. VS Code handiest consumes a lot of memory when I open more than one tasks with dozens of files. In performance benchmarks, VS Code easily outperforms PyCharm. Since VS Code would not try and be a complete IDE and keeps it easy as a textual content editor, the memory footprint, startup time, and overall response of VS Code are much better than PyCharm.

2. Extensibility: The PyCharm IDE provides extensibility via plug-ins. Currently, PyCharm has nearly 3,000 extensions indexed on the JetBrains website. On the other hand, VS Code is designed to be a simple editor that can be converted directly into a full IDE using extensions. VS Code has an extension for just about everything, and it's very easy for builders to create their own. All of these extensions can be observed within the VS Code Marketplace. This way VS Code finally ends up being more extensible than PyCharm.

3. Ease of use: PyCharm has a number of functions that most people do not frequently need (superior code refactoring tools), and it is a touch confusing to know wherein to locate the configuration options if you have not used them before.  Configuring VS Code is a good deal easier to get around. All you need to do is type Ctrl + Shift + P and a command panel will seem wherein you may look for something you need to do, and it's going to seem in the results.

For that reasons I chose work on VS Code.

# Comparison between Linux and Windows :
1. Open Source : Unlike Windows which is a commercial operating system, Linux is open source software available for free download. There are hundreds of Linux distros available, of which nearly five hundred are under active development. Ubuntu is one of the most popular desktop Linux distributions. I am currently using it.
2. Secure : Linux is more secure than Windows. Because you do not need to use antivirus software. Since it is open source, many developers are working on it and everyone can contribute code. It is possible that someone will find a vulnerability long before hackers can target a Linux distro.
3. Faster Software Updates : When you use Linux, you will get software updates faster. If the bugs are found by someone, the users get the updates right away, and they don't have to wait for long. Development tools and libraries are freely available.

For that reasons I chose work using Linux commind line.
# Comparison between GitHub and GitLab:
1. **Authentication Levels :** With GitLab, you may set and modify people's permissions according to their roles. In GitHub, you may specify whether or not someone could have read or write access to the repository. With GitLab, you may offer access to the problem tracker (for example) with out giving permission to the source code. Obviously, that is high-quality for groups and large companies with role-primarily based totally contributors.
2. **GitLab CI vs GitHub Actions :** One of the big differences between GitLab and GitHub is the continuous integration/delivery built into GitLab. CI is a huge time saver for many development teams and a great way to ensure quality nobody likes pulling requests that break your app. GitLab offers its CI for free. No need to use an external CI service. And if you're already familiar with an external CI, you can obviously integrate with Jenkins, Codeship, and others. It is clear that GitLab was approaching the DevOps market earlier than its competitor as well as providing an operations dashboard that allows you to understand the dependencies of your development and DevOps efforts.
